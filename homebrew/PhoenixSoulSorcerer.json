				"Your power draws from the immortal flames of the legendary phoenix and the celestial radiance of the firebird. That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creatures, you can invoke fiery energy and holy radiance, gaining the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost, as conflict is present within the very soul. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed while the celestial might of the firebird desperately tries to keep it in check, advocating redemption and forgiveness. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a mixed reputation (deserved or not) that ranges from being reckless, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them. Others strive to embrace the firebird's guidance, having the reputation of being proud, yet kind, seeking to guide and redeem those have lost their way. A rare few try and seek a balance between the destructive urges of the phoenix and the redeeming mercy of the firebird, though a successful attempt at this has never been officially documented.",
