				"When the {@creature Metal Giant|WMC} is formed, it is seamless, and you appear inside a 10-by-10-foot room where you control the giant from, its actions and movements are yours to command. You can enter and exit the metal giant from this room with an action. While you are inside, the metal giant can use your sight and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma for its saving throws and ability checks. If you step outside, the metal giant becomes inoperable. If you step outside the metal giant, or if it perishes, you appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the giant of your choosing.",
				"Depending on the metal used for the spellcasting, the metal giant gains different properties. The metal giant cannot be dispelled and is permanent. If its hit points reach 0, the metal giant will melt into a puddle of metal in a 20-foot radius. If the metal is not destroyed, you can use it to cast the spell once again if you have the diamonds and lightning."
