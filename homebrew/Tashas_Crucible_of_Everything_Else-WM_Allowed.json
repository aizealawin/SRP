When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it, seeing the object for what it really is. To others, the decoy projects the illusion of a medium humanoid of your choice that performs a taunting dance or an intimidating gesture goading them to fight it. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the puppet to move up to 20 feet.",

On a successful save, a creature realizes that the projected humanoid is an illusion and becomes immune to the effects of this spell for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to the {@condition charmed} condition automatically succeed on this save. The effect on a creature also ends if it takes any damage."
