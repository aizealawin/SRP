Work with your DM to determine the nature of your contract, how it might be enforced, what directive best suits your campaign, how closely you might be monitored, and what the consequences might be for breaking it. Breaking your contract, however, shouldn’t mean an immediate end for your character. Instead, it should create interesting and meaningful complications.",
						"For example, if you serve a marut hunting someone who broke an extraplanar contract, your patron may suddenly appear to drag you back to the Halls for judgement should you be discovered aiding your quarry or allowing it to escape justice. As punishment, you might temporarily lose access to one or more of your warlock class features, or be assigned a proctor to observe you more carefully, such as a modron for a familiar."
