				"Most people have trained their lives by the sword or the bow. But not for some who venture on a different path. Guns have always been on the forefront of weapon technology. Lethal. Precise. A history book in the right hands of a marksman. A dagger might leave a kingdom leaderless, but a bullet seeds into life itself -- plant one and watch something die. Those that hear a sound that cracks like thunder, an imminent end for one on the other side of the barrel, they all cower and fear, and run for cover.",
				"The clerics who wield guns are of a person who excels in battle, protecting others from would-be threats or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor as well as gods of destruction and death, conquest and domination. Other war gods could take a more neutral stance, encouraging their priests in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.",
